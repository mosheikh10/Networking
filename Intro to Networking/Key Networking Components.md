# 🔑 Key Networking Components

In any network, there are a few key devices that make sure everything runs smoothly — from managing data to keeping it secure.

---

## 🧩 1. Switches
**Function:** Connects different devices within the same local network (LAN).  
**Role:** Think of a switch as a **coordinator** that keeps communication flowing efficiently.

### 💡 Notes
- Links up devices like PCs, printers, and servers in one network.  
- Keeps data organised and reduces congestion.  
- Makes internal communication within a LAN faster and more reliable.

## 🚦 2. Routers
**Function:** Routes data between separate networks.  
**Role:** Works like a **navigator** that decides the best path for data to travel.

### 💡 Notes
- Connects your home or office LAN to the wider internet.  
- Sends data to the correct destination outside your network.  
- Plays a big role in internet access and network performance.

## 🛡️ 3. Firewalls
**Function:** Monitors and filters all traffic that goes in and out of a network.  
**Role:** Acts as a **protective barrier** that blocks unwanted or harmful access.

### 💡 Notes
- Shields systems from hackers or unauthorised users.  
- Applies rules to control which data can enter or leave.  
- Helps maintain security in both local and cloud setups.

## 🧠 Quick Recap
| Component | What It Does | Easy Analogy |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Switch** | Handles data flow within a network | 🧑‍💼 Network Coordinator |
| **Router** | Connects multiple networks together | 🗺️ Navigator |
| **Firewall** | Protects and filters network traffic | 🛡️ Security Wall |

Together, these three devices make up the **foundation of most modern networks**, balancing performance and protection.
