# 🌐 Domain Name System (DNS)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** acts as the **internet’s directory** 📘, helping computers and humans communicate by turning easy-to-remember names like `google.com` into machine-readable IP addresses such as `142.250.190.78`.

## 💡 Core Concept
- 🔄 **Purpose** → Converts **domain names** into **IP addresses**.  
- 👥 **Human vs Machine** → People remember names; computers use numbers.  
- ⚡ **Advantage** → Makes browsing faster and more user-friendly.

## 🧭 How DNS Works
1. You enter `www.google.com` in your browser.  
2. DNS looks up the IP address (e.g., `142.250.190.78`).  
3. Your browser uses that IP to connect and display the website.

## 🧾 Quick Recap
- DNS is the **address book** of the internet.  
- It bridges **human language** and **computer language**.  
- Without it, we’d need to memorize long strings of numbers for every website.
