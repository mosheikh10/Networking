# 🌍 DNS Components: Nameservers & Zone Files Explained

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** works like the phonebook of the internet — converting human-friendly names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses that computers understand. Two key parts make this work: **nameservers** and **zone files**.

## 🖥️ What Are Nameservers?

Nameservers are **special servers** responsible for answering DNS queries, such as:
> 💬 “What’s the IP address for this domain?”

### 🔑 Types of Nameservers

- ✅ **Authoritative Nameservers** → Contain the official DNS records for a domain (the “final source of truth”).
- 🔄 **Recursive Nameservers** → Do the lookup work for you. They contact other servers, find the answer, and cache it for faster responses next time.

📘 **Example Command:**
```bash
dig +short NS google.com

output:
ns1.google.com.
ns2.google.com.
ns3.google.com.
ns4.google.com.
```

## 📂 Zone Files = DNS Instruction Sheets

* A **zone file** is a **text file** stored on authoritative nameservers.
* It contains the **rules for a domain**.

### Common Records:

* 🌍 **A Record** → Maps a domain → IP address
* 📧 **MX Record** → Tells where email should go
* 🖥️ **NS Record** → Lists which nameservers are in charge

📌 Example snippet:

```
google.com.   IN  A   142.250.190.78
google.com.   IN  MX  10 smtp.google.com.
google.com.   IN  NS  ns1.google.com.
```
